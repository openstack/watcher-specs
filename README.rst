Watcher Specifications
======================


This git repository is used to hold approved design specifications for
additions to the Watcher project.  Reviews of the specs are done in gerrit,
using a similar workflow to how we review and merge changes to the code itself.
For specific policies around specification review, refer to the end of this
document.

The layout of this repository is::

  specs/<release>/

Where there are two sub-directories:

  specs/<release>/approved: specifications approved, but not yet implemented
  specs/<release>/implemented: implemented specifications
